# Color-Correction-using-Augmented-Reality
This project is from May 2018. 
The idea behind the project was to apply similar technique to that of an enchroma glass to correct colors with the sole purpose to pass the ishihara test.
Light has multiple variables like hue, temperature, saturation, etc, that effects its color. Enchroma glasses use patented technique to overcome the patients ability to understand colors by altering the variables of the light.
Similarly, this project aims to use a mobile app using which one can pass the ishihara test. So far, the project includes filters for Deuteranopia, Protonopia and Tritanopia, with only the Deuteranopia tested with an actual patient.
